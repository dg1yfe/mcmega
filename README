MCmega is a port of the MC70 firmware to the AVR platform.
It provides an alternative firmware for Motorola MC micro transceivers to enable the use of those radios for HAM radio.
The project includes a PCB (printed ciruit board) with an ATMega64 which is designed to replace the original CPU on the GLN6628B/GLN6984A command board used in the MC micro model EZA9.
